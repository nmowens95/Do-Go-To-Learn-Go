// Swap Functions With Pointers

/*
Goal: The code intends to swap the values of two variables using pointers.
1. Write swapPointers Function:
	- Define a function named swapPointers that takes two pointers to integers (*int) as arguments.
2. Inside the function:
	- Create a temporary variable to hold the value of the first pointer (*xPtr).
	- Update the value of the first pointer to the value of the second pointer (*yPtr).
	- Update the value of the second pointer to the temporary variable.
3. Implement main Function:
	- Declare two variables x and y and initialize them with different integer values.
	- Print the original values of x and y.
4. Swap the Values:
	- Create pointers xPtr and yPtr pointing to x and y respectively.
	- Invoke the swapPointers function, passing xPtr and yPtr.
5. Display Updated Values:
	- Print the updated values of x and y after swapping.
6. Experimentation:
	- Modify the initial values of x and y to observe different swaps.
	- Explore different ways to use pointers and functions to manipulate values.
	- Write your own tests.
