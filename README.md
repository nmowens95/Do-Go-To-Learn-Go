# Go-Practice
When learning any new language the syntax isn't typically the issue... it's usually the concepts.
Not only that but sometimes it's hard to build small projects based on a concept you need to learn.

I made this not only for me to learn myself, but I want to share small practical problems that are more bite sized.
It's definitely true, you learn by doing/practicing. The goal of this project is to work through these concepts
and write them from SCRATCH. You will be given instructions and some hints but writing a function from start
to finish and implementing them on top of other functions will concrete more learning than just adjusting a couple of missed syntax errors in a line of code.

This is what you make it. Avoid looking for the answer, try to brute force a solution. Then run a test or two. Don't like it? Then refactor it.

Use google, your courses and notes. But whatever you do, write your own code. I even reccomend brute forcing once, then re-writing while explaining out loud.

-This project has the potential to grow with more problems, answers(especially more improved answers) and content.
    -That being said, make mistakes, write bad code. Lets learn together and don't be afraid of failure.
