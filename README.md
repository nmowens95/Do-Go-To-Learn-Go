<h1>Want bite sized problems to learn concepts in Go? Look no further.</h1>

-  It can be hard to learn smaller concepts by only building tailored projects around those topics... that's where these problems come in.

- It's definitely true, you learn by doing and practicing. The goal here is to provide problems to work through concepts, build repitition and to help understand.

- The key here is to write these problems from SCRATCH (lets avoid tutorial hell). You will be given instructions and some hints, but it's important to know how everything strings together and putting your fingers on the keyboard typing out the syntax over and over.

- You'll get out of this what you make it. Avoid looking at the answer right away, try to brute force a solution. Need practice writing tests? Write a test or two. Don't like it? Then refactor it.

- Use google, your courses, notes or whatever you like. But whatever you do, write your own code. I even reccomend brute forcing a solution once, then re-writing it while explaining out loud.

- The problems primarily focus on a specific concept but isn't mutually exclusive. Example: a problem using channels may have pointers.

- Currently there is a small project creating a Web Crawler! This is a small project that uses go routines to add in some real practicality.

- There is also a capstone project, this is a Task Manager. There will be further instructions in the folder, you will build this on your own and a reference to the project will be found here: ...(to come soon)

## Installation
 
You can either look at the instructions on your own, write your own problems or clone the repository and work off the given files:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nmowens95/Do-Go-To-Learn-Go
```

Now check the list within the directory:
```bash
  ls
```
From current directory use the following command along with the folder of choice:
```bash
  cd <specified file>
```
## Lessons Learned


- Interacting with go routines, channels, mutexes and pointers
- Reading a text file
- Crawling a website, using tokens 
## Roadmap
- Room for more problems and additional examples
- Adding additional resources for others to refer to
- Reference to an example of Capstone project
