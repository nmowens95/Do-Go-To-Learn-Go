Looking for some bite sized problems to learn concepts in Go? Well look no further.
-  Sometimes it's hard to learn smaller concepts and only building tailored projects to learn those things

- It's definitely true, you learn by doing/practicing. The goal of this project is to work through concepts with pracitcality and repitition to help learn

- The key here is to write them from SCRATCH. You will be given instructions and some hints but writing a function that interacts with other functions from start to finish will get you much further than adjusting a bit of syntax from a given problem

- This is what you make it. Avoid looking for the answer, try to brute force a solution. Then run a test or two. Don't like it? Then refactor it.

- Use google, your courses and notes. But whatever you do, write your own code. I even reccomend brute forcing once, then re-writing while explaining out loud.

- There are different types of problems as well as a small project: #web-scraper and a capstone project: #task-manager that can help take your understanding even further
## Installation
 
You can either look at the instructions on your own, write your own problems or clone the repository and work off the given files:
