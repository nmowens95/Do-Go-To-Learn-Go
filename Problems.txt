Practice Problems:

Pointers:
Problem: Swap Function with Pointers
Write a function that takes two integer pointers and swaps the values they point to. Test the function by passing two integer variables and printing their values before and after the swap.

Channels:
Problem: Sum Calculator with Channels
Create a function that calculates the sum of a list of integers concurrently using channels. Divide the list into two halves and sum each half concurrently. Then, sum the results to find the total sum. Print the final sum.

Mutexes:
Problem: Concurrent Counter with Mutex
Implement a concurrent counter using a mutex to synchronize access. Create multiple goroutines that increment the counter simultaneously. Ensure that the counter is safely incremented and print its final value.

Goroutines:
Problem: Print Numbers Sequentially
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using separate goroutines. Ensure they print in sequential order. For instance, the first goroutine prints 1, the second prints 2, and so on.

Capstone Project:
Problem: Concurrent Task Manager with Database and Channels

Objective:
Create a task manager that allows concurrent creation, deletion, and updating of tasks while interacting with a database. Use goroutines for concurrent operations, channels for synchronization, 
pointers for efficient data handling, and mutexes for safe access to shared data.

Components:

Task Structure: Define a Task struct with fields like ID, Name, Description, Status, etc.
Database: Use SQLite or another simple database to store task data.
Concurrency Elements: Use goroutines, channels, mutexes to handle concurrent CRUD operations on tasks.
Endpoints: Implement CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing tasks.
Testing: Write tests to verify the concurrency mechanisms, database operations, and API endpoints.
This project will integrate all the fundamental concepts—pointers for efficient data handling, channels for synchronization, 
mutexes for safe concurrent access, and goroutines for concurrent execution—in a practical scenario. It will provide hands-on 
experience in managing a concurrent application with multiple components interacting together.
